# monsoon-backup-mongo
Add support for MongoDB backups on [`monsoon`](https://github.ibm.com/apset/monsoon).

## Requirements
This plug-in is build on top of [`mongodump`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongodump/#bin.mongodump),
so you will need to have [`mongo-tools`](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-tools)
installed. 

If you already have the `mongod` server or `mongo` client installed then you 
should have `mongodump`. If not, you can install them using the 
[official packages](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/#packages)
or build by [source](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-tools).
